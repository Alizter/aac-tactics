equations, modulo associativity and commutativity of some operators.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

Please refer to Tutorial.v for a succinct introduction on how to use
this plugin.

To understand the inner-working of the tactic, please refer to the
.mli files as the main source of information on each .ml

documentation in directories doc/ and html/, respectively.
