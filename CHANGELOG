AAC_tactics 0.2-pl2 :
-----------------

- Improved the handling of nullifiable patterns.

AAC_tactics 0.2.1 :
-----------------

- backport of some debian patches (thanks to S. Glondu)

AAC_tactics 0.2 :
-----------------

- Several operators can share a given unit (like max and plus sharing zero)
- Added some support to rewrite in inequations (using inequations)
- Better priting functions for aac_instances
- Overhauled inference of morphisms and operators :
  * Lift the previous requirement to have at leat one AC and one A operator
  * Binary operations are infered before morphisms (hence List.assoc can be recognized as being Associative)
- Should now be able to handle goal with evars (but this is not unification modulo AC)
- Added several new instances of Associative and Commutative operators
- The old syntax to declare AC and A operators is no longer supported
- The tactics do not abstract the proof they built (was troublesome if evars appeared)
